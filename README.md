# WebGL Boilerplate

This repository, `WebGL_BoilerPlate`, contains the boilerplate code that will be the foundation for all my future WebGL projects.

## Overview

The boilerplate code in this repository is essentially a simple triangle rendered using WebGL. It serves as a starting point for more complex WebGL projects, providing the basic structure and error checking code that are common across such projects.

## Features

- **Simple Triangle**: The boilerplate code includes the implementation of a simple triangle in WebGL. This serves as a basic example of how to render a shape using WebGL.

- **Error Checking**: The code includes robust error checking mechanisms. This helps in identifying and handling potential issues that may arise during the execution of WebGL code.

## Usage

To use this boilerplate for your WebGL projects, simply clone this repository and build upon the provided code.
